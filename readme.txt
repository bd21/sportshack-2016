This is a live peer-to-peer sports betting app created in 20 hours at the Seattle Sports Tech Hackathon.  Users are initially shown a live feed of current and past bets of their friends.  To make their own bet on a current game, users select live games, offensive players, a statistic to bet on, and a time expiration.  Once a bet request is submitted to another user and accepted, they appear on the live feed on the homepage for all friends to see.

Our web app uses the React library and makes Javascript calls to make requests to both Firebase and the SportsRadar API.  It forwards these requests through a simple python server to get around CORS blocks.  We used Firebase (NoSql, hierarchical parent-child relationships) to store users, user bets, authentication, and bets made by each user's friends.
